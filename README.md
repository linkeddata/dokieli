**Objective**: to enable researchers (in Web Science for example), to share and
reuse research knowledge by employing the native Web stack.

Linked Research is set out to socially and technically enable researchers to
take full control, ownership, and responsibility of their own knowledge, and
have their contributions accessible to the society at maximum capacity, by
dismantling the use of archaic and artificial barriers.

This is to work towards a solution where researchers can publish and consume
research documents that are both human and machine-friendly.

See also a proposed [acid test](http://csarven.ca/enabling-accessible-knowledge#acid-test)
aimed at this.

## Dive into dokieli
dokieli is a single HTML 5 Polyglot document. Different CSS are used to
present the information for different media e.g., screen, print. JavaScript is
used to <em>progressively enhance</em> the document and bring in interactivity.
In a nutshell:

* Documents are human and machine-<em>readable</em>.
* Using the <em>plain old semantic HTML</em> marking process, with further
semantic annotations using RDF and microformats.
* Intended to minimize friction in publishing and consuming; no installations,
server, or account requirements. No out of band tooling. Works on local machine
/ Web browser.

The dependencies listed below are only enhancements, and so they are optional.
Everything is still functional from ground up (whether you are using a Line Mode
Browser or Firefox Nightly). If you do not want them, they can be removed or
